**This plugin is strongly connected to OpenAI API and uses it's services (<a href="https://openai.com/api/policies/service-terms/" target="_blank">API TERMS & POLICIES</a>). Right now, the only endpoint supported by the plugin is the text completion (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/text-completion" target="_blank">API Documentation</a>), which is labeled as LIMITED BETA. Based on that, there might be some unexpected outtakes or errors. In addition, user should also be aware that the plugin is only designed to help with text completion and not with optimizing search engine rankings. Therefore, users should not rely solely on this plugin for SEO purposes and should also follow all established SEO best practices.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is your plugin FREE? =
Actual (first version) is for free, however you will need also to sign up to Open AI, which have pricing on their website.

= How many articles I can generate at once? =
It depends ðŸ™‚ If you use shared hosting, I'd suggest to start with ~3 articles per job and if everything goes ok, you can try more. I tried 50 on my own server.

= What if I have already my own Posts? =
TicoSEO uses custom post type, so it will not mess up with your content. When your generated content will be ready, you can change its type to Posts and e.g. update also its category.

= Does TicoSEO plugin kill the SEO? =
Not even closely. Google is going to adapt the AI technology very soon and we all will have to adapt. On the other hand, it will be interesting to watch how will SERP change this year.
